# VirtualElaine
Virtual Personal Task Manager to allow a user to manage their tasks and due dates all in one place.

## Introduction

The goal of this application will be to create a personal organization management application. It&#39;s main goal is to allow the user to organize all the tasks that they have to do in their life whether they are at work, study or personal related and also from those tasks to dinner at schedules and prioritize modules in order to help the user better take care of organizing their tasks.

### Problem Statement

All my life I would say that my greatest struggle has been my organization throughout elementary school I had my parents watching over me but throughout high school and college I&#39;ve been stuck with the burden of taking care of my organization. One of the major issues that I&#39;ve been countered is not being able to keep track of all my tasks in one place and not being able to complete those tasks because in the end I just lose them through my daily routine. This is where the application comes in to try and solve the issue of task management and having them all in one place with also reminders to know which Tasks to prioritize.

### Purpose

As previously elaborated, the applications main purpose will be for personal organization. I think that the two main applications for this software application lie in homework and assignment management as well as personal task organization such as doing dishes, cleaning up the house etc. Next I also see some people who are more micromanaging using this to really take care of every aspect of their lifestyle so even scheduling events and maybe parts of their day such as time for reading etc.

### Expectations

My expectation for the app is for the user to be able to create tasks in the system and give those tasks specific labels and do that in order to manage them.

### Gait

The approach that I will be using for this project will be a step-by-step approach consisting of building my US first and then building the system logic. When looking at simply the UI the application will be pretty simplistic but once we delve into the technical side of the application that is where it shines especially not only accomplishing its goals but showing what I have learned through this semester&#39;s course of mobile application development.

## Application

### Rudimentary Features

The basic application would be able to create a task and save it onto the system using database tables saving the date and what not but would not act dynamically based on his values. It would stay is simple to do/reminder app.

### Additional Features

When we get into the additional features this is where the application will shine on the default menu it will have a search item to be able to find the proper tasks it will allow the user to create their own labels and will also be able to create reminders and pop-ups for items when they become near their expiry date. The future potential that I will not be delving into for this application would be the one of creating some form of metrics to measure for instance the average completion time for each project the average amount of time left before completion compared to the time the item was due etc.

### Potential Challenges

The part that will be most challenging will be the searching of tasks and also potentially the different sorting methods to be used for the lists other more complicated tasks might be the creation of pop-ups based on the dates.

### Unrealistic Aspects

In theory, an application such as this one one synchronizing with an online resource would be able to handle multiple users on the database. However, since I will not be creating a login screen for the application any person who downloads the application will have access to the same tasks that&#39;s making this application only useable by a single user. If I had more time I would be able to create the login screen and have multiple users have their own tasks simultaneously.
